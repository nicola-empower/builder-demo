Understood. We are shifting gears from "Panic & Repair" (Therma Heat) to **"Vision & Legacy"** for **Apex Construction**.

I have noted your request: **Focus on the Homepage only.** I will remind you later to circle back to the inner pages (Project Gallery, specific Service pages, and the "Start Your Project" form) to flesh out the full site demo.

### The Persona: "The Visionary Builder"
Since this is high-end residential and commercial work (no emergency call-outs), the tone needs to be **assured, architectural, and premium**.

* **The Goal:** To make a "man with a van" builder look like a high-end construction firm that handles £500k+ contracts.
* **The Vibe:** We aren't selling "bricks and mortar"; we are selling **lifestyle upgrades, property value, and dream realization.**

Here is the homepage copy for **Apex Construction**.

### 1. Hero Section (The "First Impression")

### 2. The "Why Apex?" Section (The Value Prop)

Construction shouldn't be chaotic. At Apex, we bring order to the build process. We bridge the gap between your architect’s drawings and the final coat of paint, ensuring every phase is delivered on time, on budget, and to the highest standard.
