Understood. We are shifting gears from "Panic & Repair" (Therma Heat) to **"Vision & Legacy"** for **Apex Construction**.

I have noted your request: **Focus on the Homepage only.** I will remind you later to circle back to the inner pages (Project Gallery, specific Service pages, and the "Start Your Project" form) to flesh out the full site demo.

### The Persona: "The Visionary Builder"
Since this is high-end residential and commercial work (no emergency call-outs), the tone needs to be **assured, architectural, and premium**.

* **The Goal:** To make a "man with a van" builder look like a high-end construction firm that handles £500k+ contracts.
* **The Vibe:** We aren't selling "bricks and mortar"; we are selling **lifestyle upgrades, property value, and dream realization.**

Here is the homepage copy for **Apex Construction**.

### 1. Hero Section (The "First Impression")
*Refining what is on the screen to make it punchy.*

**Headline:**

**Sub-headline:**
From architectural new builds to transformative extensions. We combine structural integrity with design excellence to create spaces that define luxury living.

**Trust Signals (The Stats Bar):**

**Headline:**
**Master Craftsmanship. Managed Professionally.**

**Body:**
Construction shouldn't be chaotic. At Apex, we bring order to the build process. We bridge the gap between your architect’s drawings and the final coat of paint, ensuring every phase is delivered on time, on budget, and to the highest standard.

* **Fixed-Price Contracts:** detailed scope of works with transparent billing. No hidden costs.
* **Federation of Master Builders:** Fully accredited, insured, and vetted for your peace of mind.

### 3. Services Section (The "High Ticket" Items)
*We need to frame these as major investments, not small jobs.*

**Headline:**
**Construction Services for the Modern Home**

* **Luxury New Builds:**
    We turn empty plots into landmark properties. Working alongside the region's top architects to deliver bespoke homes.
* **High-End Extensions:**
    Need more space? We seamlessly integrate open-plan living areas, kitchen extensions, and multi-story additions that add significant value to your property.

*This is where you sell the web dev package. It implies a slick, digital onboarding process.*

**Headline:**
**Your Dream Home, Delivered in 4 Steps**

New Section 1: The Featured Project Spotlight
Place this after the "Services" section. This is visually heavy. It tells the user: "We do big, complex jobs."

Headline: Project Spotlight: The Harborne Renovation

Sub-headline: A complete structural reconfiguration and double-story extension for a 1920s heritage property.

The Details (3 column layout or bullet points):

The Brief: Create an open-plan family living space while preserving the property's period character.

The Challenge: Complex steelwork requirements and tight planning restrictions.

The Result: A seamless blend of contemporary glass and traditional brickwork, delivered 2 weeks ahead of schedule.

Button: [ View Full Case Study ]

(Why this sells your web services: It shows the tradesperson that they can upload photos and "brag" about their work easily. It makes them look like an established firm with a portfolio.)

New Section 2: The "Apex Standard" (Risk Reversal)
Place this right before the Testimonials. High-end clients are terrified of "cowboy builders." This section kills that fear.

Headline: Our Guarantee: Built on Integrity

Body: We don't cut corners. Every Apex project is backed by our rock-solid workmanship guarantee and full insurance coverage.

The 3 Pillars (Icons):

Fully Insured: £10m Public Liability and Employers' Liability cover for total peace of mind.

JCT Contracts: We use industry-standard contracts so everyone knows exactly where they stand regarding costs and timelines.

10-Year Warranty: All structural works are covered for a decade, giving you security long after we’ve left the site.
